	* taku-table.c: (calculate_columns):
	Request a table size of (1,1) (which effectively crops the table)
	after the cells have been reflowed, not before.
	
	(taku_table_size_allocate):
	Calculate columns before calling size_allocate on the parent
	class. This removes an extra shuffle that could be seen when
	resizing.
