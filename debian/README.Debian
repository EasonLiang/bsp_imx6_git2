The Debian Package ca-certificates
----------------------------------

Common CA certificates PEM files, installed in /usr/share/ca-certificates/

It includes the following certificates:
 - spi-inc.org certificate
 - db.debian.org certificate
 - debconf.org certificate
 - Mozilla builtin CA certificates
 - brasil.gov.br certificate
 - cacert.org certificate

configuration file:
 /etc/ca-certificates.conf
	- managed by debconf
   # dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

 update-ca-certificates will update /etc/ssl/certs
	make hash symlinks
	generate ca-certificates.crt (single-file version)

/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt may be used by the web browsers
in Debian, such as w3m, when deciding what secure web sites to trust.
For w3m package, it has ssl_ca_path configuration in /etc/w3m/w3mconfig,
so it works without any configuration.  You can specify 
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt for ssl_ca_file instead.


How certificate will be accepted in ca-certificates package
-----------------------------------------------------------

 - submit *GPG signed* bug report to ca-certificate with severity normal.
   the bug report should include
     - description of the CA
     - how to obtain CA cert pem or paste it in the bug report
     - license of the CA certificate
     - fingerprint and/or hash value of the cert
 - get 2 or 3 recommendation ("seconded" mail) from other people to 
   the bug report, GPG signed.
   I won't accept if the CA is requested by only one people.
