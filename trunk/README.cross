This version of the prelinker has a number of patch that enable cross 
prelinking.  Specific patches to address CPUs common to embedded 
systems, that have not yet been merged upstream, also exist in this version.

Please contact <mark.hatle@windriver.com> if you have a question about this
version.  The original author, and open source maintainer is not responsible
for the modified version!

Compilation
-----------

In order to build this, you will likely need to regenerate many of the
autotools files.  I suggest:
libtoolize --copy --force
aclocal -I m4
autoconf
automake --add-missing
