This package contains libnsl. libnsl is a library containing the
public client interface for NIS(YP) and NIS+.

This code was formerly part of glibc, but is now standalone to
be able to link against TI-RPC for IPv6 support.

The NIS(YP) functions are still maintained, the NIS+ part is
deprecated and should not be used anymore.
