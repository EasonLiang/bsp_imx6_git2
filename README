# Shared MIME Info

This package contains:

- The freedesktop.org shared MIME database spec.
- The merged GNOME and KDE databases, in the new format.
- The update-mime-database command, used to install new MIME data.

For more information about the database see the [Shared MIME Info Specification here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/).

## Installation

To install do the usual:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

If you want to install to your home directory, you should instead do:

	$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
	$ make
	$ make install

You'll need to make sure that $HOME/.local/bin is in your PATH, of course.
