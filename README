# Shared MIME Info

The shared-mime-info package contains:

- The core database of common MIME types, their file extensions and icon names.
- The update-mime-database command, used to extend the DB and install a new MIME data.
- The freedesktop.org shared MIME database spec.

It is used by GLib, GNOME, KDE, XFCE and many others.

For more information about the database see the [Shared MIME Info Specification here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/).

## Installation

To install do the usual:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

If you want to install to your home directory, you should instead do:

	$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
	$ make
	$ make install

You'll need to make sure that $HOME/.local/bin is in your PATH, of course.


It requires glib to be installed for building the update command.
Additionally, it uses intltool for translations, though this is only a dependency for the maintainers.
This database is translated at Transifex.
