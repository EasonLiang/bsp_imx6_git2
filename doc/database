There are two databases.  The log database contains a record of operations
and events.  (Operation logging is optional.)  The file database contains a
record of known files.  In general, the file database is configured with
sqlite options favoring stability, while the log database is configured for
speed, as operation logging tends to outnumber file operations by a large
margin.

FILES:
	id (unique key)
	path (varchar, if known)
	dev (integer)
	ino (integer)
	uid (integer)
	gid (integer)
	mode (integer)
	rdev (integer)

There are two indexes on the file database, one by path and one by device
and inode.  Earlier versions of pseudo ignored symlinks, but this turned
out to create problems; specifically, if you had a symlink to a directory,
and accessed a file through that, it could create unexpected results.  Names
are fully canonicalized by the client, except for functions which would
operate directly on a symlink, in which case the last path component is not
replaced.

It is not an error to have multiple entries with the same device and inode.
Updates to uid, gid, mode, or rdev are applied to every file with the same
device and inode.  Operations by name are handled by looking up the name
to obtain the device and inode, then modifying all matching records.

If a file shows up with no name (this should VERY rarely happen), it is stored
in the database with the special name 'NAMELESS FILE'.  This name can never
be sent by the client (all names are sent as absolute paths).  If a later
request comes in with a valid name, the 'NAMELESS FILE' is renamed to it so
it can be unlinked later.

Rename operations use a pair of paths, separated by a null byte; the client
sends the total length of both names (plus the null byte), and the server
knows to split them around the null byte.  The impact of a rename on things
contained within a directory is handled in SQL:
	UPDATE files SET path = replace(path, oldpath, newpath) WHERE
		path = oldpath;
	UPDATE files SET path = replace(path, oldpath, newpath) WHERE
		(path > oldpath || '/') && (path < oldpath || '0);
That is to say, anything which either starts with "oldpath/" or is exactly
equal to oldpath gets renamed, with oldpath replaced by newpath... The
unusual constructions are to address two key issues.  One is that an "OR"
would prevent proper use of the index.  The other is that a pattern,
such as "LIKE oldpath || '/%'", would prevent use of the index (at least
in sqlite).  The gimmick is that the only things greater than 'a/' and less
than 'a0' are strings which begin with 'a/' and have additional characters
after it.

LOGS
	id (unique key)
	stamp (integer, seconds since epoch)
	operation (id from operations, can be null)
	client (integer identifier)
	dev (integer)
	ino (integer)
	mode (integer)
	path (varchar)
	result (result id)
	severity (severity id)
	text (anything else you wanted to say)
	tag (identifier for operations)
	access (integer)

The log database contains a primary table (logs).  As of this writing it
is not indexed, because indexing is expensive during writes (common, for
the log database) and very few queries are usually run.

The log database also contains, when created, tables of operations, result
types, and severities.  These exist so that queries can be run against
a log database even if these values might have changed in a newer build
of pseudo.  The tables of operations and severities are just id->name pairs.
No enforcement of the relation is currently provided.

The log database "tag" field, added since the initial release of pseudo,
is available for tagging operations.  When a client connects to the
pseudo server, it passes the value of the environment variable PSEUDO_TAG;
this tag is then recorded for all log entries pertaining to that client.

The log database "access" field, added since the initial release of pseudo,
stores values which are bitwise masks of the values 1 (execute), 2 (write),
4 (read), and 8 (append), used to report the modes with which a file was
opened.  These values are not completely reliable.  A value of 0 is typical
for non-open operations, and a value outside the 0-15 range (usually -1)
indicates that something went wrong trying to identify the mode of a given
open.
